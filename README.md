## Description
This project compares two algorithms that solve
the GamePigeon word hunt game. 

### The Game
The game starts with a board like the one pictured
above. The goal of the game is pretty simple, 
find as many words as you can amongst the mix
of random letters. You, however, can only connect
letters next to or diagonal from one another and you
can only use each letter once.

### Algorithm Benchmarking
This project uses three main methods to benchmark 
how successful the algorithms are at solving
the word hunt.
1. \# of words found
2. Speed of execution
3. (For Trie Solver) \# of paths pruned
